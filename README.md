## drp: Docker R-patched

This repository aims to provide (possibly daily) builds of Docker containers based on
the then-current state of the R-patched SVN repository.

It also provides profiling support via the added `-pg` compilation flag.

It is part of the [Rocker](https://github.com/rocker-org) project.
